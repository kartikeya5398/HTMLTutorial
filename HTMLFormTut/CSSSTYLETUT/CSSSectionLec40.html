                    The indefinite article takes two forms. It’s the word a when it precedes a word that begins with a consonant. 
                    It’s the word an when it precedes a word that begins with a vowel. 
                    The indefinite article indicates that a noun refers to a general idea rather than a particular thing. 
                    For example, you might ask your friend, “Should I bring a gift to the party?” 
                    Your friend will understand that you are not asking about a specific type of gift or a specific item.
                     “I am going to bring an apple pie,” your friend tells you. 
                     Again, the indefinite article indicates that she is not talking about a specific apple pie. 
                     Your friend probably doesn’t even have any pie yet. The indefinite article only appears with singular nouns.
