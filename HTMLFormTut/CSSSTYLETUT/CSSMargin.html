        <p class="letterspacing underline">“I am going to bring an apple pie,” your friend tells you. 
            Again, the indefinite article indicates that she is not talking about a specific apple pie. 
            Your friend probably doesn’t even have any pie yet. The indefinite article only appears with singular nouns. 
           Consider the following examples of indefinite articles used in context:
           An unvisited link is underlined and blueA visited link is underlined and purpleAn active link is underlined and red
           The indefinite article takes two forms. It’s the word a when it precedes a word that begins with a consonant. 
           It’s the word an when it precedes a word that begins with a vowel. 
           The indefinite article indicates that a noun refers to a general idea rather than a particular thing. 
           For example, you might ask your friend, “Should I bring a gift to the party?” </p>
