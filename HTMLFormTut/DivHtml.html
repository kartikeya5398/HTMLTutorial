            The <a> tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another.

                The most important attribute of the <a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.
                
                By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:
                
                An unvisited link is underlined and blue
                A visited link is underlined and purple
                An active link is underlined and red
                The indefinite article takes two forms. It’s the word a when it precedes a word that begins with a consonant. 
                It’s the word an when it precedes a word that begins with a vowel. 
                The indefinite article indicates that a noun refers to a general idea rather than a particular thing. 
                For example, you might ask your friend, “Should I bring a gift to the party?” 
                Your friend will understand that you are not asking about a specific type of gift or a specific item.
                 “I am going to bring an apple pie,” your friend tells you. 
                 Again, the indefinite article indicates that she is not talking about a specific apple pie. 
                 Your friend probably doesn’t even have any pie yet. The indefinite article only appears with singular nouns. 
                Consider the following examples of indefinite articles used in context:

                Please hand me a book; any book will do.

                Please hand me an autobiography; any autobiography will do.
                Exceptions: choosing a or an
                There are a few exceptions to the general rule of using a before words that start with consonants and an before words 
                that begin with vowels.
                The first letter of the word honor, for example, is a consonant, but it’s unpronounced.
                In spite of its spelling, the word honor begins with a vowel sound. Therefore, we use an.
